**Hints:**
- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this.

## 🔍 Initial Observations

Upon accessing the challenge URL, we are greeted with a themed web page titled:

From the navigation menu, we have the following options:

Clicking on **Admin Login** brings us to a login form requesting `username` and `password`.
